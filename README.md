Game developed in Android Studio enviroment using only Java with the help of the libGDX library.

You'll be able to move the spaceship with the pressure of the mouse or, if running on a mobile phone, of your finger. The ships fire automatically and has a limited amount of shields, once you run over of those it will start to explode every time it gets hit. Don't worry, is an easy mode demo, so you'll never actually lose even after your life counts goes below 0 (what a shame though!).

In order to don't have any issues is recommendable to run it from the MyGdxGame, at least at the first launch. 
Enjoy!
